Project Title: Learning Platform for Web3 Development
Project Overview: This learning platform is a comprehensive educational tool designed to introduce and engage users with Web3 technology, blockchain, and decentralized applications (DApps). Tailored for developers and enthusiasts interested in Web3, the platform offers interactive courses, hands-on projects, and a community-driven approach to learning. By providing targeted content, it aims to demystify blockchain technology and equip learners with the skills needed to thrive in the evolving Web3 space.
Features and Functionality:
1.	Course Catalog: A curated list of courses covering essential Web3 topics such as Blockchain Basics, Smart Contract Development, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and Artificial Intelligence in Web3. Each course is segmented by difficulty (beginner, intermediate, and advanced), allowing learners to progress at their own pace.
2.	Project-Based Learning: Courses are structured around practical projects, enabling learners to build real-world applications. These projects encourage hands-on learning, allowing students to deploy their own smart contracts, build NFTs, or create DApps by the end of each course.
3.	Community Hub: A dedicated space for developers to collaborate, share insights, and support each other. Learners can participate in forums, attend virtual events, and work together on open-source projects, fostering a vibrant learning community.
4.	Job Board Integration: A decentralized job board connects graduates with job opportunities in the Web3 industry. Users can apply for Web3 roles directly on the platform, making it a one-stop resource for learning and career advancement.
5.	Sponsor-Focused Functionality: Designed to fulfill requirements for specific sponsor prizes, this platform incorporates tools for sustainability and inclusivity in Web3, aligning with sponsor goals like promoting green tech, fostering community growth, and supporting job creation in Web3.
Tracks:
•	Web3 Education and Skill Development: Focused on delivering quality Web3 education, this track helps new developers gain foundational and advanced skills in blockchain and decentralized technologies.
•	Community and Collaboration: Emphasizing collaboration, this track supports community engagement and knowledge-sharing among developers, helping participants learn through mentorship and peer support.
•	Career Development and Opportunities: With an integrated job board, this track connects learners with potential employers, making it easier to transition from learning to employment in Web3.
Sponsor Prize Consideration: For the Sponsor Prize, this project addresses key requirements by:
•	Promoting Eco-Friendly Blockchain Practices through education on energy-efficient blockchain technologies.
•	Supporting Inclusivity and Access by creating content that is accessible to developers in emerging markets, especially Africa.
•	Driving Web3 Job Creation by connecting learners directly with job opportunities in the Web3 space, addressing workforce development goals set by sponsors.



### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
